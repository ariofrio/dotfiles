" commands like `d<NUMBER>d`.

"### Searching/moving

" Automatically insert a `\v` before any string you search for. This makes searches
" use normal regexes instead of Vim's crazy default regex characters. I already know
" Perl/Python compatible regex formatting, why learn another scheme?
nnoremap / /\v
vnoremap / /\v

" Make Vim deal with case-sensitive search intelligently. If you search for an
" all-lowercase string your search will be case-insensitive, but if one or more
" characters is uppercase the search will be case-sensitive. Most of the time
" this does what you want.
set ignorecase
set smartcase

" Apply substitutions globally on lines. For example, instead of
" `:%s/foo/bar/g` you just type `:%s/foo/bar/`. This is almost always what you
" want (when was the last time you wanted to only replace the first occurrence
" of a word on a line?) and if you need the previous behavior you just tack on
" the `g` again.
set gdefault

" Work together to highlight search results (as you type). It's really quite
" handy, as long as you have the next line as well.
set incsearch
set showmatch
set hlsearch

" Make it easy to clear out a search by typing `,<space>`. This gets rid of the
" distracting highlighting once I’ve found what I’m looking for.

" Make the tab key match bracket pairs. I use this to move around all the time
" and `<tab>` is much easier to type than `%`.
nnoremap <tab> % vnoremap <tab> %

" The next section makes Vim handle long lines correctly. These lines manage
" my line wrapping settings and also show a colored column at 85 characters
" (so I can see when I write a too-long line of code).

" [hard wrapping][] for more information.

" This will disable the arrow keys while you're in normal mode to help you
" learn to use `hjkl`. Trust me, you want to learn to use `hjkl`. Playing a lot of
" Nethack also helps.
"
" It also disables the arrow keys in insert mode to force you to get back into
" normal mode the instant you're done inserting text, which is the "right way"
" to do things.
"
" It also makes `j` and `k` work the way you expect instead of working in some
" archaic "movement by file line instead of screen line" fashion.

" I also like to make `;` do the same thing as `:` -- it's one less key to hit
" every time I want to save a file: I don't remap `:` back to `;` because it seems
" to break a bunch of plugins.

nnoremap ; :

" Finally, I really like TextMate's "save on losing focus" feature. I can't
" remember a time when I didn't want to save a file after tabbing away from my
" editor (especially with version control and Vim's persistent undo).

"## Using the Leader

" Vim dedicates an entire keyboard key for user-specific customizations. This
" is called the "leader" and by default it's mapped to `\`. As I mentioned in
" the previous section I prefer to use `,` instead.
" 
" Each person will find little things they type or execute often and want to
" create shortcuts for those things. The leader is a kind of "namespace" to
" keep those customizations separate and prevent them from shadowing default
" commands.
" 
" Here are a few of the things I use leader commands for. You'll certainly
" have different ideas than I do, but this might give you an idea of what you
" can do.
 
" I use `,W` to mean "strip all trailing whitespace in the current file" so I
" can clean things up quickly.
nnoremap <leader>W :%s/\s\+$//<cr>:let @/=''<CR>

" This next mapping imitates TextMate's `Ctrl+Q` function to re-hardwrap
" paragraphs of text:
nnoremap <leader>q gqip

" This last mapping lets me quickly open up my `~/.vimrc` file in a vertically
" split window so I can add new things to it on the fly.
nnoremap <leader>ev <C-w><C-v><C-l>:e $MYVIMRC<cr>

"## Prettyness

" One of the most important things for a text editor is that it look pretty. Let's
" make Vim beautiful. By the way, if you are looking for the color scheme, it's
" included below as a bundle.

" Remove gVim's distracting and unnecessary toolbar.
